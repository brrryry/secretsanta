Hey! This is an overengineered Secret Santa website that I made for some friends TvT \
The code structure isn't very good, but I made it in 2 days.

## Getting Started (pasted from template)
First, clone the repo.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/brrryry/secretsanta.git
cd secretsanta
```

Then, install dependencies.
```bash
npm i
```

Finally, run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
