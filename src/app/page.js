      <p>this is a secret santa website. i made this for some friends on a whim.</p>
      <p>i used json 4 database (im way too lazy for this)</p>

      <br />===
      <p>had to use auth since i dont want anyone's personal internet on blast</p>
      <p>this is the most scuffed cookie setup i have ever used</p>
      <p>i spent wayyyy more time making the site secure than actually like...making the email/secret santa algorithm...</p>

      <br />===
      <p>as a reference, you have a username, email and notes.</p>
      <p>pls make the username at least something everyone can identify (it really doesn't have to be your real name tho)</p>
